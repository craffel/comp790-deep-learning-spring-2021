# COMP790: Deep Learning

Instructor: [Colin Raffel](http://colinraffel.com)

Term: Spring 2021

Meeting time: Mondays and Wednesdays, 12:30-1:45pm

Office hours: TBD

Deep learning is the branch of machine learning focused on training neural networks.
Neural networks have proven to be powerful across a wide range of domains and tasks, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and beyond.
The success of these models is partially thanks to the fact that their performance tends to improve as more and more data is used to train them.
Further, there have been many advances over the past few decades that have made it easier to attain good performance when using neural networks.
In this course, we will provide a thorough introduction to the field of deep learning.
We will cover the basics of building and optimizing neural networks in addition to specifics of different model architectures and training schemes.
The course will closely follow the "[Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)" textbook and will have a standard lecture/homework/exam format.

## Prerequisites

Students need to have taken the following courses:
  - Machine learning (one of COMP562, COMP755, STOR565, or equivalent)
  - Linear algebra (one of MATH210, MATH347, MATH577, or equivalent)
  - Multivariate calculus (one of MATH233, MATH522, or equivalent)
  
Further, it is recommended that students have some basic familiarity with statistical concepts.
Finally, students must be proficient in reading and writing Python code.

## Course structure

Further details about the course schedule, grading, late work policy, and other logistics are forthcoming.

## Conduct

I ask that we all follow the [NeurIPS Code of Conduct](https://nips.cc/public/CodeOfConduct) and the [Recurse Center Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules).
I value the perspectives of individuals from all backgrounds reflecting the diversity of our students.
I broadly define diversity to include race, gender identity, national origin, ethnicity, religion, social class, age, sexual orientation, political background, and physical and learning ability.
I will strive to make this classroom an inclusive space for all students.
Please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve.

Acts of discrimination, harassment, interpersonal (relationship) violence, sexual violence, sexual exploitation, stalking, and related retaliation are prohibited at UNC-Chapel Hill.
If you have experienced these types of conduct, you are encouraged to report the incident and seek resources on campus or in the community.
Please contact the Director of Title IX Compliance/Title IX Coordinator (Adrienne Allison, adrienne.allison@unc.edu), Report and Response Coordinators (Ew Quimbaya-Winship, eqw@unc.edu; Rebecca Gibson, rmgibson@unc.edu; Kathryn Winn kmwinn@unc.edu), Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPs) (confidential) in Campus Health Services at (919) 966-3658, or the Gender Violence Services Coordinators (confidential) (Cassidy Johnson, cassidyjohnson@unc.edu; Holly Lovern, holly.lovern@unc.edu) to discuss your specific needs.

## Resources

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill facilitates the implementation of reasonable accommodations, including resources and services, for students with disabilities, chronic medical conditions, a temporary disability or pregnancy complications resulting in difficulties with accessing learning opportunities.
All accommodations are coordinated through the Accessibility Resources and Service Office. See the ARS Website for contact information: https://ars.unc.edu or email ars@unc.edu.
Relevant policy documents as they relate to registration and accommodations determinations and the student registration form are available on the ARS website under the About ARS tab.

CAPS is strongly committed to addressing the mental health needs of a diverse student body through timely access to consultation and connection to clinically appropriate services, whether for short or long-term needs. Go to their [website](https://caps.unc.edu/) or visit their facilities on the third floor of the Campus Health Services building for a walk-in evaluation to learn more.

## Changes

I reserve the right to make changes to the syllabus, including project due dates and test dates.
These changes will be announced as early as possible.
